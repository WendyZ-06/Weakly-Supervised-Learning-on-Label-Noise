+ Project Summary:
  + In this project, we created 3 models to classify the images. The baseline model is the logistic regression model, which yields a relatively low accuracy of around 24%. Model I uses the CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) and has a better accuracy of about 47.6%. Model II uses a VGG model (Visual Geometry Group) to clean the noisy labels and then applies the same method as Model I. It has a better performance reaching accuracy around 58.3%.


**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md))

For this project, all members first tried some simpler models like decision trees and random forests. Next, Srushti, Kejun, and Wenchang worked on Model I. Luke, Qingyang and Xinyu worked on Model II. All members attended group meetings and helped each other understand project requirements and fix the code. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
