+ Project Summary:
  + In this project, we created 3 models to classify the images. The baseline model is the logistic regression model, which yields a relatively low accuracy of around 24%. The Model I uses CNN(convolutional neural network) and has a better accuracy of about 47.6%. Model II uses a VGG network to clean the noisy labels and then applies the same method as Model I. It has a better performance reaching accuracy around 58.3%.
	

**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md))

For this project, all members first tried some simpler models like decison trees and random forest. Next, Srushti,Kejun and Wenchang worked on Model I. Luke, Qingyang and Xinyu worked on Model II. All members atteneded group meetings and helped each other in understanding project requirements and fixing the code . All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
